Traditionally managed through paper submissions or emails, this manual process suffers from inefficiencies and lacks traceability, impacting the proper selection of suppliers. The digitalization of this process emerges as a crucial innovation, offering a unified platform where businesses can publish tender calls and suppliers can apply.\n\nInitiating our final year project, we focus on developing a platform to digitalize the tendering process. Our goal is to create an integrated solution that enhances transparency, traceability, and efficiency. This platform will centralize submissions and provide analytical tools to objectively and comprehensively evaluate offers, reducing human errors and optimizing supplier selection. Thus, our project aims to contribute to a more streamlined and equitable management of tender calls, addressing contemporary needs of both businesses and suppliers.\n\nStructure of the Report:\n- Preliminary Study: Provides an overview of the project context, examines existing solutions, and details our own solution and methodology.\n- Project Initialization: Focuses on the pre-sprint phase, defining functional and non-functional requirements, discussing technological decisions, and outlining the platform architecture.\n- Project Releases: Describes specific project releases, covering specification, design, and implementation stages, along with summaries of key findings and progress at each phase.",
